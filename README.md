# MazeEngine
Overview<br/>
>*Graphical Application that utilizes a recursive backtracking algorithm to draw a maze, then uses Dijkstra's shortest path finding algorithm to solve the maze every time.<br/>
>*Pygame module was used for the main rendering algorithm<br/>
>*Tkinter module was used for the user prompt window<br/>
>*Enter the size of the maze, press enter to draw, press shift to solve.
